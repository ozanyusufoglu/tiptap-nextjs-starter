# Tiptap and Next.js integration

This is an example implementation of _Tiptap Rich_ text editor with **Next.js** and **Tailwind**. You could use it as a starter boilerplate for your text based projects.

In it‚Äôs simplest form, it‚Äôs enough to add Starterkit extension which enables many rich text editor features such as bold, bulletlist. etc

---

Steps to install are below, see documents for more detail

https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/getting-started/install/nextjs

Install Next.js and Tiptap Packages.

```bash
# create a project
npx create-next-app my-tiptap-project

# change directory
cd my-tiptap-project

# install dependencies
npm install @tiptap/react @tiptap/pm @tiptap/starter-kit

```

Create the Tiptap editor component

```jsx
"use client";
import { useEditor, EditorContent } from "@tiptap/react";
import StarterKit from "@tiptap/starter-kit";

const Tiptap = () => {
  const editor = useEditor({
    extensions: [StarterKit],
    content: "<p>Hello World! üåéÔ∏è</p>",
  });

  return <EditorContent editor={editor} />;
};

export default Tiptap;
```

Integrate it to your app

```jsx
import Tiptap from "../components/Tiptap";

export default function Home() {
  return <Tiptap />;
}
```

Here are some extras for more options,

- The Link is not available in the Starterkit packet. You need to install the extensions first then import into Tiptap component. Just follow the same pattern for other official extensions.

  `npm install @tiptap/extension-link`

- To be able to drag and drop nodes in your editor in a similar fashion to Notion you need Drag extension, which is paid. But you are not limited to official extensions, I added Global Drag Handle, which is a community extension to make it possible. Check the repo for installation details:

  - [_https://github.com/NiclasDev63/tiptap-extension-global-drag-handle_](https://github.com/NiclasDev63/tiptap-extension-global-drag-handle*)

- You could see that a Bubble Menu pops up when you select a piece of text and there are a few menu options more. Basically a fixed menu, bubble menu or floating menu, they all work with the same children button elements, you just change the parent element.

- You could find ‚Äúis-active‚Äù, ‚Äúnot-active‚Äù and ‚Äúdrag-handle‚Äù classes in the global.css file inside your `app/` root folder.
- To reach the content of the rendered content in the editor, you could use `.getHTML()` or `.getJSON()` methods on editor object.

```jsx
const content = editor.getHTML();
or;
const content = editor.getJSON();
```
