# Tiptap and Next.js integration

This is an example implementation of _Tiptap Rich_ text editor with **Next.js** and **Tailwind**. You could use it as a starter boilerplate for your text based projects.

In it‚Äôs simplest form, it‚Äôs enough to add Starterkit extension which enables many rich text editor features such as bold, bulletlist. etc

Steps to install are below, see documents for more detail

https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/getting-started/install/nextjs

Install Next.js and Tiptap Packages.

```bash
# create a project
npx create-next-app my-tiptap-project

# change directory
cd my-tiptap-project

# install dependencies
npm install @tiptap/react @tiptap/pm @tiptap/starter-kit

```

Create the Tiptap editor component

```jsx
"use client";
import { useEditor, EditorContent } from "@tiptap/react";
import StarterKit from "@tiptap/starter-kit";

const Tiptap = () => {
  const editor = useEditor({
    extensions: [StarterKit],
    content: "<p>Hello World! üåéÔ∏è</p>",
  });

  return <EditorContent editor={editor} />;
};

export default Tiptap;
```

Integrate it to your app

```jsx
import Tiptap from "../components/Tiptap";

export default function Home() {
  return <Tiptap />;
}
```

Here are some extras I added to Starterkit,

1. I added the Link extension to show how to enable features which are not available in the Starterkit packet. You need to install extensions first, like below

   `npm install @tiptap/extension-link`

2. I added the Global Drag Handle package, which is a community extension, to be able to drag and drop nodes in your editor in a similar fashion to Notion ;) Check the repo for installation details. Kudos and thanks to the contributors

3. You could see that a Bubble Menu pops up when you select a piece of text in the editor, check documentation for more menu options. Basically a fixed menu or bubble menu or floating menu, they all work with the same children button elements.

4. You could find ‚Äúis-active‚Äù, ‚Äúnot-active‚Äù and ‚Äúdrag-handle‚Äù classes in the global.css file inside your `app/` root folder.
5. To reach the content of the rendered content in the editor, you could use .getHtml() or .getJSON() methods on editor object.

```jsx
const content = editor.getHtml();
```
